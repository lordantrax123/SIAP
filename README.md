# Prediction of Instagram posts popularity
## Project from subject called Data Mining and Data Analysis Systems

### Synopsis: </br>
Instagram is free, and today one of the most popular social networks, which allows its users to process and share photos and videos (up to 15 seconds long) via Android and iOS platforms. 
Instagram was created and launched in October 2010, and in April 2012 it was bought by Facebook. The online service quickly gained great popularity, with more than 100 million active users in February 2013.

### 1. Problem definition
The problem that will be addressed in the project is the prediction of the popularity of Instagram posts. 
Popularity, in this case, is considered by the number of users' interactions (comments, likes) on a particular Instagram post. 
Prediction will be performed based on previous successful posts (posts) of users, based on the description of the posts, the tags used and at what time they were published. </br>
### 2. Motivation
Trends and popularity largely drive social media in the modern age. There are over a billion users on Instagram today. This is a large-scale market with the potential to be optimized to increase popularity, viewership, and even revenue.
We hope to use this market to create a project that can identify key variables to increase the ratio of the number of likes on a post to the number of average likes a user gets on a post. Using these features, we want to evaluate this relationship so that posts can be optimized to be most exposed to influencers as well as ordinary users. Also, we may come across unexpected templates in the characteristics of popular instagram posts, such as the use of a certain image processing filter and / or certain hashtags

### Technology used:
• Searching and collecting data was done manually, and then the data was "refined" using the OpenRefine tool;
• Customizing data for analysis, transformation and data analysis and evaluation was done in part in the RapidMiner software environment. 
• Semantic analysis was done using NLP techniques, in particular: Stanford CoreNLP, http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/.
